COE 379L: Software Design For Responsible Intelligent Systems
=============================================================

The objective of this course is to introduce students to scalable data analysis and 
machine learning techniques for designing, implementing, validating and operating responsible 
intelligent systems for engineering. The course covers algorithms, techniques and tools for 
applying data analytics and machine learning to real-world problems. Through a series of 
projects spanning the course of the semester, students design and implement 
ML models . The course attempts to strike a balance between foundational and 
state-of-the-art techniques.
